## ðŸ§  Conquering Lunar Lander and Bipedal Walker with Neuroevolution

This repository contains the code and experiments featured in my Medium article, where I explore the application of neuroevolution techniques to tackle the Lunar Lander and Bipedal Walker environments. Traditional reinforcement learning methods, like Deep Q-Learning, often struggle with continuous action spaces. However, by evolving neural networks using genetic algorithms, we were able to achieve significant success in these challenging environments.

### Highlights:
- **Neuroevolution Implementation**: We used evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural network weights, providing an alternative to gradient-based learning.
- **Lunar Lander**: Tested and refined neuroevolution techniques in this simpler environment, achieving a 98.10% win rate over 1,000 iterations.
- **Bipedal Walker**: Applied the successful methods from Lunar Lander to this more complex environment, achieving a 91.6% win rate in 1,000 simulations.
- **Challenges and Insights**: Discussed the limitations of neuroevolution, particularly in scaling to more complex tasks like Bipedal Walker's hardcore mode, and explored potential improvements.

This project showcases the potential of neuroevolution in continuous reinforcement learning scenarios. For more details, check out the full article on Medium.
